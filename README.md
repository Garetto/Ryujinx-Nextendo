## What this fork adds

This repository is a fork of the open-source [Ryujinx](https://github.com/Ryubing/Ryujinx) Nintendo
Switch emulator. The emulation core (CPU, GPU, audio, input, filesystem) is unchanged from upstream:
this fork's own additions are limited to the networking layer and the surrounding user experience,
so supported games can be played online through [Nextendo Network](https://github.com/NextendoNetwork)
with no manual configuration, custom hosts file, or SSL bypass needed. See the
[org page](https://github.com/NextendoNetwork) for what Nextendo Network is and which games it supports.

> own legally dumped games and system files, exactly as with upstream Ryujinx.

## How online works

This fork implements the client side of Nextendo Network entirely inside the emulator, so no external
tools are needed:

- **Hostname redirection.** A built-in DNS-MITM resolver redirects the game's online hostnames to the
  configured Nextendo servers. Exact hosts-file entries still take precedence, so a custom server can
  be targeted without rebuilding.
- **Account tokens.** The emulator locally signs the account (BAAS) `id_token` that some titles verify
  before allowing online entry. The signing key is **not** bundled: it is supplied at runtime (see
  [Configuration](#configuration)).
- **NAT and P2P.** NEX titles use peer-to-peer networking (Pia) once matchmaking completes. This fork
  keeps the emulator's UDP NAT mapping alive across the P2P bring-up so hole-punching succeeds.
- **First-run wizard, online status, in-game friends, and a kill-switch** round out the experience.
- **Client attestation.** Official builds sign their API requests with a private key baked in at build
  time, so a server can tell an official release apart from an arbitrary client presenting the same
  public application ID.

None of the server infrastructure is hardcoded in this repository: addresses and keys come from
environment variables and fall back to loopback when unset, so an unconfigured build simply behaves
like stock Ryujinx offline.

## Configuration

Point a build at a Nextendo Network server (or your own) with these environment variables:

| Variable                     | Purpose                                                            | Fallback   |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `NEXTENDO_SERVER_IP`         | Address the main online hostnames resolve to.                     | `127.0.0.1`|
| `NEXTENDO_NAT_IP`            | Address of the second NAT-check responder (required by NAT probe).| `127.0.0.1`|
| `NEXTENDO_BAAS_SIGNING_KEY`  | PEM of the RSA key used to sign account `id_token`s. May instead be placed in a `nextendo_baas.pem` file next to the executable. | none (throwaway key) |

If none are set, online features stay dormant and this build runs as a normal offline emulator.

### Custom-server host and port

The in-app **Custom server** setting also accepts a fully qualified domain name
(FQDN) or IPv4 address and a port. This exists for self-hosted deployments that
publish their NEX endpoint on a normal DNS name and a non-standard TCP port,
rather than requiring an operating-system
or firewall redirect from the game's usual HTTPS port (443).

Ryujinx resolves the configured hostname with the host operating system, then
continues to redirect the game's expected server names to that IPv4 address. For
TCP connections to that redirected server only, it changes port 443 to the
configured custom port. Other connections, including NAT/P2P traffic, are left
unchanged. The optional second NAT-probe host remains separate because it is not
an NEX or Eagle endpoint.

Existing `nextendo_server_override.json` files using `ServerIp` and `NatIp`
remain supported as legacy field names.

## System requirements

To run comfortably, your PC should have at least:

- 8 GiB of RAM
- 6 CPU cores
- A GPU released within the last 10 years, supporting OpenGL 4.6 or Vulkan 1.4
- Windows 10 (20H1) or newer, a modern Linux distribution, or macOS Big Sur (Apple Silicon) or newer

Failing to meet these requirements may result in poor performance or crashes.

## Building

This fork builds like upstream Ryujinx: you need the .NET SDK (see `global.json` for the required
version). See [COMPILING.md](COMPILING.md) for details. In short:

```sh
git clone <this-repository>
cd Ryujinx-Nextendo
dotnet build src/Ryujinx/Ryujinx.csproj -c Release
```

## Credits

This fork stands on the shoulders of the emulator it forks and the projects Ryujinx itself builds on:

- **[Ryujinx](https://github.com/Ryubing/Ryujinx)**, originally created by **gdkchan** and continued by
  the Ryubing community: the entire emulation core.
- [LibHac](https://github.com/Thealexbarney/LibHac): filesystem.
- [AmiiboAPI](https://www.amiiboapi.com): Amiibo emulation.
- [ldn_mitm](https://github.com/spacemeowx2/ldn_mitm): one of the available local-multiplayer modes.
